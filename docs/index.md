# PyTiled Parser

PyTiled Parser is a Python Library for parsing maps made with the [Tiled Map Editor](https://www.mapeditor.org) for 2D games in a strictly typed fashion.

PyTiled Parser is not tied to any particular graphics library, and as such could be used with [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy), [Pyglet](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io), [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news), or any other Python graphics library.

While we don't offer any direct integrations to other libraries/frameworks, [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy) has full integration for PyTiled Parser out of the box, and would be a good resource to use as an example implementation.
